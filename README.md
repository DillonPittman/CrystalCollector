Crystal Collector is our first jQuery homework assignment.
The user interacts with four onclick elements to perform all the game's functions.

The user is given a random number that they must reach to win.
Each image is given a hidden random number.
The user must click the images to add the hidden number to their haul, winning if they reach the number exactly, losing if they go over.
